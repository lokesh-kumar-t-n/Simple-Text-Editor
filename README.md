Here is the code for a simple text editor.
The code is implemented in C language and make use of dynamic memory efficient.And of course it has its own pros and cons.
The operations that can be performed includes insert a new character, move right, move left , delete and so on.
The implementation of all the functions are given along with comments for better understandment of the code and/or the logic
behind the working of the code. The file mine.c contains the whole of both implementation and client side code.
You are always free to make changes to the file and pull a request to me, if you found a better way to implement or you found any
bug in the code.
Thank you very much and happy coding
